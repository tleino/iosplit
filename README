iosplit - split console to separate input and output boxes

Useful when working with standard I/O programs that don't follow
the request-response (giving output for an input) pattern, but may
write to the terminal at random times, messing up the screen, i.e.
programs that send events at arbitrary times such as IRC, MUD, MQTT.
